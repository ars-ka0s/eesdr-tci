# eesdr-tci

Python package to interact with Expert Electronics SDR TCI control interface.

This package is a work-in-progress and will probably change quite a bit in the near term.

It is currently based on the [Protocol TCI.pdf, version 1.9](https://github.com/ExpertSDR3/TCI/blob/b3c46e14e829bac7dd4a9a749ce05556b874b569/Protocol%20TCI.pdf) from the ExpertSDR3/TCI documentation repo.

I have tested basic connectivity, receiving and changing parameters, and receiving and transmitting audio streams in various formats.

Until everything stabilizes, take a look at the [example](example) folder to see a couple different ways it can be used.
